# RS-CP-ASSIGNMENT
all the works and assignment solved for rs cp program 

#explation for 1(a) :
The outer loop runs from n/2 to n, so it runs about n/2 times which will result in  O(n).
The inner loop starts at 2 and doubles each time like 2, 4, 8,... to n that’s O(log n).
multiple both and we get the ans of O(n log n)

# explanation for 1(b) 
The time complexity of this floorSqrt function is O(√n) because the loop runs until i*i exceeds x, which happens when i is close to  the square root of x.
